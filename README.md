This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What is this?

This is a demo project - a single page react app which spits out some Key Stage 1 maths problems. Focussing on react, not aesthetics (it's ugly, I know).

# How do I run this?

- install node v12 (see [version](./.nvmrc)). I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node.
- (if you're using nvm too) `nvm use` in your shell.
- install dependencies `npm i`.
- run the app in dev mode with `npm start`.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
